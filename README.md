#4.Business Logic 
Our website that organizes trips: It has a database structure that includes tables of users, trips, destinations and reviews. The users table stores information about website users, such as name, email address, and account details. The flight schedule stores information about flights, such as destination, dates, and cost. The destinations table stores information about various destinations, such as location, landmarks, and activities. Finally, the reviews table will store users' reviews of trips, such as ratings and comments.

SQL Queries: SQL queries are used to retrieve data from a database and display it on a website. For a website that organizes trips, SQL queries can be used to retrieve information about trips, such as destination, duration, cost, and other details. SQL queries can also be used to store information about trips, such as the number of people going on the trip, trip dates, and payment information.

HTML Forms and NodeJS: HTML Forms and NodeJS can be used to create a website that organizes trips. HTML forms can be used to allow users to enter information about flights, such as destination, duration, cost, and other details. NodeJS can be used to process information from HTML forms and store them in a database. NodeJS can also be used to create a user interface for a website, allowing users to view and manage their journeys.
